## About
The project was written in `elm` as part of a challenge for a JavaScript meetup:
[JSMD challenges](https://github.com/JSMD/challenges/tree/master/challenge%20%236).

The code in itself is not that difficult yet it was an interesting exercise in writing `elm`.

## Building
Running `elm-reactor` will compile and run the project.
First it's important to have all the necessary `elm` tools.
